			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Not really got much to say, the population grew a bit, generally not that exciting.</p>

					<h2>Northern Ireland's population continues to increase</h2>
					<p>On 30 June 2018, Northern Ireland's population was estimated to be 1.88 million people.</p>
					<p>Between mid-2017 and mid-2018, the population of Northern Ireland increased by 10,800 people, or 0.6%. Just over half the population were female, with 955,400 females (50.8%) compared to 926,200 males (49.2%).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="1">
					<p>Over the last 15 years, the annual rate of population change in Northern Ireland has fluctuated between a high of 1.1% in 2007 and a low of 0.3% in 2013.</p>
					<p>Over the decade from mid-2008 to mid-2018, the population of Northern Ireland has increased by a total of 102,500 people, with an average year-on-year increase of 0.6%.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="2">
					<h2>Natural change is the main contributor to population growth in Northern Ireland</h2>
					<p>The two main components of population change are <b>natural change</b> and <b>net migration</b>. The latest increase in the Northern Ireland population was a result of natural growth of 6,700 people (23,100 births minus 16,400 deaths) and an estimated growth 4,100 people due to net migration (23,600 people came to live in Northern Ireland and 19,400 people left).</p>
					<p>In the year between June 2017 and June 2018, the overall population growth due to natural change and net migration totalled 10,800 people. As in recent years, natural change was the main contributor to the increase in population.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="3">
					<h2>The population of Northern Ireland is aging</h2>
					<p>Between June 2008 and June 2018, the median age in Northern Ireland increased from 36.6 years to 38.7. The proportion of the population aged 65 years and over has increased since 2008, while the proportion aged 0 to 15 years has decreased.</p>
					<p>It is projected that from mid-2028 onwards, there will be more people aged 65 and over in Northern Ireland than children aged 0 to 15.</p>
